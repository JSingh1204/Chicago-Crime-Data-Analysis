# Chicago-Crime-Data-Analysis
This is a Data Analytics Project in which focuses on Analyzing Crime Rate of Chicago from 2012-2017.

## Introduction 
Since we all know that Chicago’s overall crime rate is considerably higher than the US average crime rate and is also
known as the crime Capital of US, the Objective of this project is to analyze Chicago’s crime rate. In this project we are
identifying longer and contemporary rates using the historical data because the increase in the crime rates has been the
topic of curiosity. Therefore, on analyzing this dataset, we are trying to determine the basic crime trends in Chicago from
2012-2017. Since, the data sets that are available on Chicago Crime data is open and large and this will help us to obtain
meaningful insights and opportunity to derive correlation between places, time and type of crime. Also, we can predict
the safety measures by performing Analysis of the Chicago Crime Data to control the crime rate.

* Did the crime rate increase in year 2017?
* What is the crime pattern with respect to months?
* What are the locations where highest number of crimes have been reported?
* What are the most commonly reported crime types? Which crime type seems to have reduced over years (2012-2017)?
